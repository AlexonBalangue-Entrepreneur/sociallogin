## Joomla and PHP Compatibility

Akeeba Social Login is compatible with Joomla! 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. It requires PHP 5.3.10 or later, the same minimum PHP version as Joomla! itself. It's also compatible with PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1.

We strongly recommend using the latest published Joomla! version and PHP 7.0 or 7.1 later _for optimal security of your site_.
