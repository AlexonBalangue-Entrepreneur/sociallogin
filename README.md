# Akeeba Social Login

A social login solution for Joomla!

## PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE

**WARNING! THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED.** It has not even reached Alpha status. DO NOT USE, IT'S NOT READY YET.

## What does it do?

This solution lets users link their social media (Facebook, Google, GitHub, Twitter, ...) account to your site. Users can then log in using their social media account on your site. The typical use case for that is Facebook login.

Moreover, it allows new users to register to your site using their social media account. For example, someone can create a user account on your site using their Facebook login. This is faster for the user and easier for you, since the email address of the user has already been verified by the social network.
