# Akeeba Social Login

A social login solution for Joomla!

## What does it do?

These plugins let users link their social media (Facebook, Google, Twitter, ...) account to your site. Users can then log in using these social media accounts. A typical use case for that is Facebook login.

Moreover, it allows new users to register to your site using their social media account. For example, someone can create a user account on your site using their Facebook login, without going through Joomla's user registration process. The created user accounts can either be activated immediately (e.g. when it's a verified Facebook account, i.e. Facebook has verified the user's email and/or mobile phone number) or go through Joomla's account activation process (click on the link sent by email). This is faster for the user and easier for you, since in most cases the email address of the user has already been verified by the social network and they don't have to go through Joomla's email address verification.
